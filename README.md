## Commit permissions

There are a few ways you can commit changes to the repository. You can either fork the repository on github by clicking on the fork button. That will give you a local version where you automatically have write access.
Alternatively, you can reach out to David Yu for collaborator/commit permissions to the original repository.

2. Click on File -> Build Settings -> Build
3. Create and select a folder outside of the repository folder (do not commit the binary output of the build to git)
4. Package the binary output of the build in a zip file (call it something distinctive - this will be the name of your iteration of the game)
5. On the github page, find the 'tags' button near the top
5. Create a new release and upload the zip file you have created
